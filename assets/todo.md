- last row and column partly outside grid
- dragging with arrows just expands selection, no moving
- menu buttons not showing the arrow key focus
- menu button can still be pressed with enter while menu open (weird darker and darker behavior, should check if already open)
- menu items overlap in menu popup
- new game in both game screen and menu popup
- scale boat images
- game not always solvable
- you can drag boats past another boats if there's space behind them
